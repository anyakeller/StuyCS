log:
We're done!

I first learned how to open files and write to new ones.

Then I actually wrote the program.
I figured out how I wanted to format the novel so it can be sorted into buckets.
Then I wrote the bucket code.
Then I dumped each line into a string with formatting.
Lastly I stuck that string in a file.
